# Bodaway-Gap-Research

Various research tools to design water infrastructure for the Bodaway Gap chapter of the Navajo nation.

- `facility-clustering` - Early experimentation with different optimization models for reservoir assignment
- `dynamics-modeling` - Optimization model of dynamics for a specific reservoir. Eventually for modeling an entire system with demand, energy, etc. dynamics.
- `source-hydro` - Case study analysis of the ineffectiveness of Hydropanels in the region
- `travel-analysis` - Early experimentation with analyzing travel times between reservoirs and demand points

## Development

This has been developed using Python `3.11.6` but any version `>=3.8` should suffice. Ensure you are in a new virtual environment and install dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
