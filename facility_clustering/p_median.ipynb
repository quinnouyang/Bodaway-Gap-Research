    "# The $p$-Median Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the $p$-median problem is to locating $p$ facilities to minimize the demand weighted average distance between demand nodes and the nearest of the selected facilities. Hakimi (1964, 1965) first considered this problem for the design of network switch centers. \n",
    "However, this problem has been used to model a wide range of applications, such as warehouse location, depot location, school districting and sensor placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The $p$-median problem can be formulated mathematically as an integer programming problem using the following model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    " $M$ = set of candidate locations  \n",
    " $N$ = set of customer demand nodes\n",

    "\n",
    " $p$ = number of facilities to locate  \n",
    " $d_j$ = demand of customer $j$, $\\forall j \\in N$  \n",
    " $c_{ij}$ = unit cost of satisfying customer $j$ from facility $i$, $\\forall i \\in M, \\forall j \\in N$\n",
    " \n",
    "### Variables\n",
    " $x_{ij}$ = fraction of the demand of customer $j$ that is supplied by facility $i$, $\\forall i \\in M, \\forall j \\in N$  \n",

    "Minimize the demand-weighted total cost  \n",

    "\n",
    "All of the demand for customer $j$ must be satisfied  \n",
    " $\\sum_{i \\in M} x_{ij} = 1$, $\\forall j \\in N$\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly $p$ facilities are located  \n",
    " $\\sum_{i \\in M} y_i = p$\n",
    " \n",
    "Demand nodes can only be assigned to open facilities  \n",
    " $x_{ij} \\leq y_i$, $\\forall i \\in M, \\forall j \\in N$\n",
    " \n",
    "The assignment variables must be non-negative  \n",
    " $x_{ij} \\geq 0$, $\\forall i \\in M, \\forall j \\in N$\n",
